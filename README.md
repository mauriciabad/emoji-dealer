The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploy

> 100% automated with GitHub Actions, just push to master. 🧙🏻‍♂️

Build the app for production to the `build` folder with:

```bash
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Notice that any lintern warning will be treated as an error during the build.
